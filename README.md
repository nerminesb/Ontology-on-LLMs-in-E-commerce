This project was developed as part of an academic assignment at UV by myself and my classmate,TCHUENDEM Joyce. It consists of two main components:

    1-Survey: A literature review focused on LLM-based recommendation systems, exploring current trends, applications, and challenges.

    2-Ontology Development: A custom ontology designed to model the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of e-commerce, specifically in the domain of online clothing shopping.
